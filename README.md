# GDELT-Project
This project utilised PySpark filtering to filter all the data related to the news of Muhammed Bin Salman's desicion to allow women to drive in Saudi Arabia. The news were surrounded with a lot of controversy, and utilising PySpark functionality and GDELT data, I used cosine similarity to compare the Saudi Arabian reactions compared to the rest of the world and compared to the Arab world.
